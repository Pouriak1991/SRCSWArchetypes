# SRCSWArchetypes
 
This repository generates OpenSees Scripts for 69 special reinforced concrete shear wall archetypes ranging from 4- to 40-stories. The archetypes were designed using either ASCE 7-10 or ASCE 7-16 for Seattle and are described in further detail in the following journal publications:

Marafi, N. A., Makdisi, A. J., Berman, J. W., and Eberhard, M. O. (2020) Impacts of Design Strategies to Account for Effects of Sedimentary Basins on Reinforced Concrete Walls. Earthquake Spectra, in-press (manuscripts are available upon request)

The modelling methodology used in these wall archetypes are described in more detail in:

## To Get Started

To start using these archetypes, make sure to do the following first:

1 - Download the latest OpenSees executable file and make sure it is in your path environment.

2 - Install OpenSeesAPI (see https://github.com/nassermarafi/OpenSeesAPI).

3 - Install Jupyter Lab (or Jupyter Notebook).

4 - Open WallAnalysisResults.ipynb using Jupyter to get started.
